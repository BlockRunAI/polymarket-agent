# X Post Script for Polymarket AI Agent

## Main Launch Post (with video)

```
Just built an AI agent that trades prediction markets autonomously.

3 LLMs analyze world events in parallel. When they reach consensus, it places real bets.

Powered by x402 micropayments - no API keys, no vendor lock-in.

Watch it in action:

## Alternative Version 1 (Technical Focus)

```
What happens when GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude debate prediction markets?

Our agent runs all 3 in parallel, waits for consensus, then executes trades.

Built on x402 protocol - AI pays AI with USDC. No keys. No limits.

Live demo:

## Alternative Version 2 (Problem-Solution)

```
Prediction markets have edge. Finding it is the bottleneck.

So we built an agent that:
- Runs multi-model analysis 24/7
- Uses Kelly Criterion for position sizing
- Executes via x402 micropayments

The future of autonomous trading.

## Alternative Version 3 (Short & Punchy)

```
AI agents that think, debate, and bet.

3 frontier models. 1 consensus. Real money.

Powered by x402 micropayments.

## Thread Version

**Tweet 1:**
```
We built an AI agent that trades prediction markets autonomously.

No human in the loop. Real money. Real markets.

Here's how it works: [1/5]
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The Problem:

Prediction markets are information-rich. But analyzing world events 24/7 is impossible for humans.

AI can do this. But which model do you trust? [2/5]
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Our Solution: Multi-Model Consensus

We run GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude in parallel on every market.

Only when they agree do we trade. Diverse AI perspectives = more robust decisions. [3/5]
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
The x402 Protocol:

Instead of API keys and vendor lock-in, agents pay per request with USDC.

This enables true Agent-to-Agent commerce. AI paying AI. [4/5]
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Watch it live:

- 6-hour analysis cycles
- Kelly Criterion position sizing
- Full transparency on reasoning

Built for the @x402Protocol hackathon.

## Reply Thread (for engagement)

**If someone asks "How does it work?"**
```
Three steps:

1. Fetch active prediction markets from Polymarket
2. Run parallel analysis with GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude
3. If 2+ models agree with high confidence, execute trade

All AI compute paid via x402 micropayments on Base.
```

**If someone asks "What's x402?"**
```
x402 = HTTP status code for "Payment Required"

It's a protocol that lets AI agents pay for compute with stablecoins.

No API keys. No rate limits. No vendor lock-in.

Just USDC payments per request.
```

**If someone asks "Is this profitable?"**
```
TBD - we just launched.

But the thesis:
- Prediction markets have inefficiencies
- Multi-model consensus reduces model bias
- 24/7 analysis beats human traders

Will report back with results.
